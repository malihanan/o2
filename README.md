# Theme
Cyberpunk Future

# Motivation
A few hundred years from now, getting uncontaminated oxygen directly from the air seems doubtful. What we will have to rely on then, will be oxygen tanks and when they will be so in demand, an app to deliver it right to your doorstep seems like a possible hit. That is exactly what our app does. 

# Features
This app shows you the status of the oxygen tank you are currently using and lets you buy and refill more oxygen. Now when you are going to spend after oxygen, you will want it to be more than just plain oxygen. So then you get to choose what flavour of oxygen you want to buy and what amount of purity would you like. Obviously, a flavoured, pure tank is going to cost you more. So you can buy these tanks and they will be stored in your store, for you to switch between them whenever you want.
